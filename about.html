  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    The first thing Kyuu remembers is the sun.

She doesn’t know where she is. She doesn’t know what she is. Her body feels unfamiliar, like something newly made, struggling to function. She reaches out, but her limbs don’t move the way she expects. She tries to stand, but balance is a foreign concept.

And then she notices it.

A small, floating orb, a piece of herself, yet separate. She instinctively knows that it belongs to her, but doesn't understand why.

With time, she begins to move. To learn. To observe.

She has no past, no memories, no identity. But as she travels this world, meeting strangers and stepping into their lives, she will become something more.

Her journey is just beginning.
