Kyuukei is a portal to my universe of intertwined stories and characters. The site is organized into separate story segments, each made up of chapters that build the narrative step by step. In addition, the Character Wiki offers detailed profiles—with spoilers—so you can dive deeper into each character's background.

Explore the story segments to follow different narrative threads, and visit the Character Wiki when you’re ready for more in‑depth details. Join our community to discuss new chapters and character updates.
