preview_description: "Kyuu gets dropped off at daycare and eats her first lunchable while orby gets sent to detention"

---
The soft creak of wooden wheels against dirt filled the air, accompanied by the rhythmic clatter of hooves pulling the wagon along the well-worn path. Sunlight filtered through the trees, casting dappled shadows over the travelers seated inside.

Kyuu sat quietly, legs tucked beneath her as the wagon gently rocked with each movement. Across from her, the merchant who had taken her in, an older man with a warm but pragmatic gaze, studied her with mild curiosity. Beside him, Duran—his hired bodyguard—leaned lazily against the wooden frame, arms crossed, one boot propped up on the edge of the seat.

Orby hovered beside Kyuu, wobbling every so often, as if taking in its surroundings.

For a long while, no one spoke. The merchant had already given up on prying anything from the strange girl. She did not react to conversation, nor did she respond to questions.

The silence was broken by a flurry of wings.

Duran’s gaze flicked upward just in time to catch a small bird fluttering above the tree line, its path unsteady as it rode the warm air currents. It wasn’t much of a meal, but a decent hunter could take it down if they were quick.

Kyuu, sitting idly, lifted a finger toward the bird.

The merchant raised an eyebrow at the motion, about to ask if she wanted it as food.

But Orby reacted first.

The orb shot forward, expanding mid-air. Pink tendrils of slime stretched outward, widening just enough to try and engulf the bird mid-flight.

Duran moved at the exact same moment.

His arm snapped forward, sending a throwing knife whirling through the air.

Orby was closing in just as Duran’s dagger struck the bird.

A clean hit.

The bird jerked, feathers scattering as it plummeted to the ground.

Orby compressed violently, the stretched slime folding back into itself where the bird had been.

It had missed.

A faint tremor ran through its form as it drifted slowly back toward Kyuu, wobbling dejectedly.

Duran chuckled, stretching his arms.
"Guess I win that one."

Orby shivered in protest, bouncing once before nestling closer to Kyuu.

The merchant sighed. “If you're done showing off, we can eat before moving on.”

He pulled the wagon to a slow stop, hopping down to retrieve the bird.

A small fire flickered in the clearing where they had made camp. The bird, now skinned and roasting over the flames, filled the air with the scent of cooking meat.

Duran sat cross-legged, turning the skewer lazily while the merchant rummaged through their supplies.

Kyuu remained still, watching the fire with the same blank stare she had held since the moment they met.

The merchant offered her a small strip of dried meat, holding it out carefully.

Kyuu stared.

Orby wobbled beside her, shifting slightly.

The merchant frowned. “Do you not know how to eat?”

No response.

Duran sighed. “C’mon, kid, you chew. Like this.”

He bit into a piece of his own food, exaggerating the motion. Chew. Swallow. Simple.

Kyuu watched, unblinking.

The merchant huffed. He reached over, gently taking Kyuu’s hand and placing the food in her palm.

Nothing.

Duran leaned forward, watching intently.

Then, finally—Kyuu’s fingers curled around the food.

She lifted it to her lips, taking a small bite.

The taste was unfamiliar, but her body responded instinctively. She chewed, slowly, methodically, before swallowing.

Duran smirked, tossing a glance at Orby. “Even the orb looks relieved.”

Orby shivered approvingly, bouncing slightly as Kyuu continued to eat.

Satisfied, the merchant nodded and returned to his meal.

With their brief meal concluded, the group resumed their journey. The merchant flicked the reins, and the wagon lurched forward, creaking along the dirt path once more. The scent of lingering smoke from the fire faded into the crisp afternoon air.

Kyuu remained silent, occasionally nibbling on the last remnants of her dried meat. Orby hovered beside her, its movements more settled now—content, but ever watchful.

Duran, on the other hand, was growing restless.

He had been intrigued by the girl’s strange behavior from the start. The way she showed no fear, no curiosity—nothing. Even now, as she ate, it was robotic, like she was going through the motions without truly experiencing them.

His gaze shifted toward the orb.

It was unnatural, that thing. The way it moved. The way it reacted.

Most people carried themselves in a way that made sense. They had small habits—blinking too much, shifting their weight when they were nervous, adjusting their clothes, scratching at an itch.

Kyuu did none of that.

She simply… existed.

Duran smirked.

Without warning, he picked up a small stone from the wagon floor and flicked it toward Orby.

The orb twisted mid-air, avoiding the projectile with an unnatural speed.

Duran raised an eyebrow.

He picked up another rock and tossed it, this time with more force.

Again, Orby dodged, effortlessly avoiding danger.

“Oh-ho,” Duran chuckled. “You're quick.”

He reached for another.

The merchant glanced over with an exasperated sigh. “Duran.”

The warning was ignored.

The next stone shot out like an arrow, barely missing as the orb dipped down at the last second. Duran was grinning now, amused by the game.

One more.

He launched it straight at Kyuu’s forehead.

Without hesitation, Orby flung itself in the way, intercepting the stone with a wet-sounding bounce before rapidly reforming.

Duran let out a low whistle.

“Overprotective little thing, aren’t you?”

Orby wobbled in response—somewhere between proud and agitated.

Kyuu didn’t react.

She continued chewing methodically, barely acknowledging the commotion.

Duran leaned back, folding his arms behind his head. “Well, at least it keeps things interesting.”

The merchant shook his head disapprovingly.

Duran smirked, flicking one last small rock toward Orby—this time, faster than before, trying to catch it off guard.

Orby noticed.

But it didn’t dodge.

Instead, it took the hit head-on.

The rock sank into its gelatinous surface, stretching it back like a taut slingshot. For a split second, Orby wobbled—then snapped back with force, launching the stone straight back at Duran’s forehead.

Smack.

Duran winced, rubbing the sore spot with a low grumble. “I Deserve that.”

The merchant snorted but said nothing.

Kyuu simply continued eating.

The wagon rolled into the bustling city of Vallaris, the heart of nobility. The streets were filled with merchants calling out their wares, nobles in fine attire gliding past commoners, and carriages rolling through the well-kept roads.

Duran hopped off first, rolling his shoulders. “I’ll grab supplies. See you in a couple hours.”

The merchant waved him off. “Yeah, yeah. I'll run a few errands before dropping the girl off.”

Duran paused, glancing once more at Kyuu. His gaze lingered on Orby for a moment longer, but he shook his head and disappeared into the crowd.

The merchant sighed, shifting the reins before guiding the wagon toward the academy’s entrance.

The heavy oak doors creaked open as the merchant stepped inside, Kyuu in tow. The scent of aged parchment and burning incense filled the air, the grand office lined with towering bookshelves.

Behind a massive desk, Mizue von Lichtspiel lounged, barely acknowledging them, her attention buried deep in an open tome.

“Whatever it is, I don’t want it,” she said lazily, flipping a page.

The merchant sighed, already bracing himself. “Not what you want, what you agreed to. I need your signature for this shipment and a discussion about the terms. And—” he gestured toward Kyuu, “—I figured you might have some insight into this one.”

Mizue didn’t even glance up. “If it’s another "gifted" orphan you want me to deal with, drop them off at the church.”

“This one's quite interesting I assure you.”

Mizue’s quill paused.

Her eyes snapped up—and for the first time, she really looked at Kyuu.

Then she noticed Orby.

Then she moved.

The chair scraped loudly against the stone floor as she stood so fast it nearly toppled over.

She rushed forward, grabbing Kyuu’s wrist before the merchant could react.

Her fingers traced along Kyuu’s arm, pressing lightly against her skin, then her collarbone, then the center of her chest. Her eyes narrowed.

Nothing.

No mana flow. No core. Human, yet—made of mana.

“...Amazing.”

Her gaze flicked to Orby. The orb trembled slightly under her scrutiny.

“Hmm.”

She reached for it.

Orby dodged.

Mizue let out a long, drawn-out sigh, shoulders slumping as if just the thought of chasing it exhausted her. Then, without missing a beat, she snapped her fingers.

A shimmering barrier of light snapped into existence, trapping Orby mid-air.

Orby flinched violently, compressing itself tightly as if startled. Then, almost immediately—it fought back.

It slammed itself against the barrier, rebounding off the invisible wall with a sharp wobble.

It stretched its form, pressing outward against the barrier, searching for even the smallest crack to slip through.

Finding none, it contracted sharply, then shot forward with full force, smashing into the barrier with a rubbery impact.

No give.

Orby twisted and expanded, forming long, slimy tendrils that lashed out, slamming against the edges like whips.

Still, the barrier held.

Mizue lazily inspected her nails.

Orby swelled, filling every inch of the magical prison, pressing so tightly that its surface rippled like boiling liquid.

Mizue yawned.

Orby froze mid-struggle, then slowly—defiantly—wobbled once.

Then twice.

Then it flopped dramatically onto the floor of the barrier in defeat.

Mizue smirked. “Thought so.”

The merchant groaned. “Mizue, I need to—”

“Trade? Yes, yes.” She waved a hand dismissively. “Drop the wares off later.”

“And what about her?”

“She’s mine now.”

Before he could argue, the doors slammed shut behind him.

Mizue grinned.

Kyuu simply stared.
