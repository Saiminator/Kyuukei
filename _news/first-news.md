This may come as a surprise but there is huge news! The Kyuukei wo Hanashi official website has been launched in early access (surprised pikachu face)!
Currently not much except for a nicer character wiki than I had on toyhou.se. As you can see, there is a story section which I intend to finally start posting to. Hopefully I can figure out this html and css nightmare to make a fun interactive story page to explore and fill it as much as possible!
