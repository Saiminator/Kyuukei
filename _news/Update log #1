Small informational update, the character list now sorts based on the popularity of the characters from the most recent poll.

I plan to set it up so that it will automatically update and delete older entries to keep an up to date and consistent popularity ranking.

As a side note, feel free to email any requests or ideas for characters. Most of the time I will already have a plot in mind for each character, but I appreciate any and all input to keep ideas fresh!
