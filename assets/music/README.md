# Character music files

Place character theme audio files in this folder. For example, Elaine's theme is expected at:

```
assets/music/elaine-sternbruch-theme.wav
```

Avoid committing binary assets directly to the repository; upload them separately to your hosting location and ensure the `src` field in the character front matter points to the desired file path.
