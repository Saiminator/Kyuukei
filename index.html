    Take a break, settle in, and explore a world where stories unfold from many different perspectives.

Kyuukei wo Hanashi isn’t a single journey, it’s a collection of tales where characters shape the world around them. Some fight for power, others seek answers, and a few are just trying to survive. At the center of it all is Kyuu, a mysterious slime girl who starts with nothing, not even an identity, but finds herself interacting with the lives of adventurers, nobles, outcasts, and monsters alike.

This site lets you choose how to explore the story, follow a single character’s journey, jump between different storylines, or dive into the lore and history behind the world itself. No matter where you start, every thread connects.


    So, where do you want to begin?
