## Background

Kyuu is a slime girl with the appearance of a human girl, characterized by her pink eyes and blonde hair. She was created when a pink, orb-shaped slime core, now named "Orby," absorbed and replicated a person for the first time. Due to the orb being unable to replicate anything non-physical, the body it produced remained limp and lifeless. While finalizing its replication, it attempted mimicking brainwaves, which unexpectedly led to the body awakening with a completely new consciousness.

When Kyuu awoke for the first time, she didn't even realize that she was alive. Only after her arm instinctively moved, covering her eyes from the sun, did she realize that she could freely move her body. She learned to move her eyes and managed to look at the world around her for the first time. Kyuu attempted to move her body, flailing around as she failed to control it properly. After a couple of hours of struggling, she managed to stand up and began to move around.

Eventually, she noticed the orb patiently floating beside her. She instinctively knew that the orb was an extension of her body and was able to control its movements by pointing her finger. After growing accustomed to her new situation, Kyuu began wandering this foreign world, attempting to understand it.

## Abilities

**Orb Control:** Kyuu's body is a replica produced by a split-off portion of the orb. Due to their hive-mind connection, she controls Orby's movements and abilities at will.

**Regeneration:** Her unique body regenerates damage nearly instantly, revealing her pink slime interior as it repairs itself.

**Effective Immortality:** With Orby’s constant reproduction of her body, she can potentially live forever—even if her body dies, Orby can reproduce it again while retaining her memories.

**Shape-Shifting:** Kyuu can have Orby morph her body to mimic another person or entity that Orby has absorbed.

**Poison Immunity:** She is effectively immune to poisons and diseases.
