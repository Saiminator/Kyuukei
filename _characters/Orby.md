## Background

Orby is a pink slime core that serves as the foundation of Kyuu’s existence. Though it lacks independent thought or will, it acts in complete harmony with Kyuu through their shared connection. When Orby first replicated a human body, its attempt unexpectedly gave rise to Kyuu’s consciousness. Since then, the two have been inseparable, with Orby functioning as both Kyuu’s anchor and her lifeline.

While Orby itself is not capable of conscious decision-making, it sometimes displays faint traces of personality from the beings it has absorbed. These echoes surface only in specific situations—when it recognizes a familiar environment, sensation, or stimulus. Despite its otherwise emotionless nature, Orby demonstrates a powerful instinct to protect Kyuu at all costs, a drive that transcends mere mimicry and hints at a deeper bond.

## Abilities

Hive Link: Orby shares a seamless connection with Kyuu, functioning as an extension of her body. Though it cannot think on its own, it responds instantly to her intent, acting as a second set of limbs, senses, or focus as needed.

Effective Immortality: So long as Orby survives, Kyuu cannot truly die. Her humanoid body can be destroyed, but Orby will immediately restore it, endlessly regenerating her form and memories.

Shape Manipulation: Though usually a simple floating orb, Orby can morph its slime into tendrils, shields, or flowing extensions. It can split, merge, or adjust its form to interact with the environment and defend Kyuu.

Residual Personality: When triggered by familiar stimuli, Orby mimics faint traits of entities it has absorbed in the past. This manifests in subtle gestures or reactions, but never reaches full consciousness.
