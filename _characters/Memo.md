## Background

Memo is an ethereal being composed entirely of mana, making her intangible to the physical world unless she chooses to manifest a temporary body. As a being of pure energy, she thrives by absorbing the mana of others, an act that also allows her to steal fragments of their memories in the process.

Despite her small stature, Memo is incredibly dangerous. She has the ability to invade an individual's mana stream and take control of their body and savor their memories. Though she does not always act with malicious intent, her curiosity and hunger for knowledge often drive her to test the limits of her abilities on those she finds interesting.

## Abilities

**Intangible Body:** Memo is made of pure mana, allowing her to phase through objects and remain untouchable unless she willingly solidifies her form.

**Mana Absorption:** By draining the mana of others, Memo temporarily weakens her target while gaining access to fragments of their memories. Lost memories typically return once their mana is restored.

**Mana Possession:** If Memo enters an individual's mana stream, she can embed herself into their mana core, taking control of their body and abilities for a limited time. Strong-willed individuals can resist her, but weakened targets are highly susceptible.
