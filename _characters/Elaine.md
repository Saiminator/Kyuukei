## Background

Elaine was born without privilege, growing up in a world where status dictated success. With no noble blood or connections to rely on, she had to push herself harder than anyone else. While learning magic, her creativity allowed her to shape it in ways that reflected her own ambitions, eventually manifesting her exceptionally rare Space Affinity through the formation of stars—dense, radiant constructs that altered gravity around them. With this ability and sheer determination, she forced her way into Ebonvale Academy, proving that talent alone could surpass lineage.

Despite her rise, Elaine has never forgotten what it was like to struggle. She doesn’t seek strength for herself alone—she believes power should protect those without it. She carries others in her gravity, pulling them up alongside her, whether they want it or not.

Her presence at Ebonvale is not without resistance—many nobles see her as an outsider, a reminder that talent can rival bloodline. However, the academy’s headmaster secretly roots for her, offering her a chance where others would not. While never outright favoring her, the headmaster ensures Elaine has the space to thrive, allowing her to prove that strength is not something inherited, but earned.

## Abilities

**Star Creation:** Elaine’s Space Affinity has manifested in the form of stellar constructs, allowing her to create dense, glowing orbs of mana that resemble miniature stars. These stars act as anchors, radiating intense energy while distorting the area around them, creating a gravitational pull. Elaine uses them both a tool for gravity manipulation and as powerful projectiles. Elaine can launch these stars at enemies, causing a gravitational distortion while near and dealing damage comparable to being hit by a speeding truck.

**Gravity Manipulation:** As an extension of her ability, Elaine can alter the gravity of her stars, causing them to pull in or repel objects, spells, or even people within their vicinity. This manipulation also applies to her own body, allowing her to adjust her weight for greater speed and agility or increase the force behind her strikes.
