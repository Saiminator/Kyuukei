## Background

Kaji's birth was marked by an unusual characteristic for a dragon: she lacked the typical desire for treasure, instead having an insatiable lust for knowledge. From a young age, she was captivated by the mysteries of physics and nature, constantly seeking answers to her endless questions. This insatiable curiosity set her apart from her kin, leading to her being considered an outcast among her clan of dragons.

## Abilities

**Dragon Body:** Kaji's dragon heritage gives her body tough defense, and extraordinary strength. Kaji can naturally produce fire from her mouth which is helpful for her experiments. 

**Dragon Eyes:** Kaji's eyes allow her to tell the purity of metal and important factors that typically assist dragons in finding quality treasure. Her eyes allow her an extreme amount of detail in her work and give her an unmatched awareness of her surroundings.

**Shape-Shifting:** Kaji like most dragons, has the ability to morph her body into a humanoid figure. Although typically a temporary transformation for most dragons, Kaji, prefers to be in this form as it allows for greater precision in her work.

**Immortal:** Although currently unsuccessful, if nothing else impedes her research, Kaji will succeed in providing herself with immortality, giving her all the time she might need for more research.
