## Background

Born to a noble family, Shimi was raised with a sense of entitlement and superiority. Her upbringing was filled with luxury and privilege, contributing to her inflated ego. She had been considered a hard-working genius since her childhood and was expected to excel at magic as well. During her first year at a school of magic, Shimi quickly learned she had no magic potential in the slightest. Her mana capacity and output were far below average, and her peers quickly left her behind. Despite being one of the brightest students when it came to written exams, Shimi was boiling inside, unable to handle being a failure. She saw her peers as wasted potential, having endless talent yet squandering it without proper training and knowledge.
