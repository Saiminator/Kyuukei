## Background

Born to a noble family, Shimi was raised with a sense of entitlement and superiority. Her upbringing was filled with luxury and privilege, contributing to her inflated ego. She had been considered a hard-working genius since her childhood and was expected to excel at magic as well. During her first year at a school of magic, Shimi quickly learned she had no magic potential in the slightest. Her mana capacity and output were far below average, and her peers quickly left her behind. Despite being one of the brightest students when it came to written exams, Shimi was boiling inside, unable to handle being a failure. She saw her peers as wasted potential, having endless talent yet squandering it without proper training and knowledge.

## Abilities

**Shimi'ing** Shimi has the ability to transform others into an copy of herself both physically and mentally while retaining their original abilities. Any contact with Shimi leads to a black, sludge like substance being created and slowly enveloping the victims body. Once they are fully covered in the sludge their bodies and personalities are replaced entirely by Shimi. During the process their old bodies and abilities are absorbed into the new Shimi giving them great power. The most effective way to trigger the transformation is by stabbing her hand into the victims chest, rendering them unable to resist. Once fully transformed, Shimi removes her hand and the wound regenerates instantly. Due to the infectious nature of the sludge, once a Shimi dies in any way, their bodies melt into a puddle of the black sludge. This sludge is more infectious and any contact will result in becoming Shimi.
