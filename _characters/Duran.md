## Background

Duran is the primary offensive fighter of Cerulean Winds, a highly skilled mercenary who relies on agility, precision, and adaptability in battle. Originally hired by Lyn to work as a temporary combat specialist, Duran quickly proved his value through his keen instincts and combat prowess, eventually becoming a permanent member of the team.

Unlike traditional swordsmen who favor brute strength, Duran excels in speed-based combat, overwhelming his enemies with rapid strikes while dodging and countering attacks with ease. His style is efficient and ruthless, aiming for vital points with deadly accuracy rather than drawn-out fights.

Outside of combat, Duran is charismatic, humorous, and easygoing, often keeping the group's morale high. However, when danger arises, he switches to a focused and serious demeanor, demonstrating the sharp instincts that make him a formidable warrior. 

While loyal to Cerulean Winds, Duran still operates with a mercenary mindset, prioritizing survival and strategy over reckless heroics. His ability to improvise in combat and analyze enemy weaknesses makes him an irreplaceable member of the team.
