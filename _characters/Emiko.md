## Background

Emiko was married into the royal family as the result of a political arrangement, intended to strengthen relations between the two noble houses. She possessed immense magical potential, and it was hoped that her child would inherit that same power. At first, she fulfilled her role dutifully but distantly, understanding that her position was one of status, not love.

As time passed, however, the king became infatuated with her, eventually growing to genuinely love her. Emiko, in turn, shared her vision of a kingdom built on equality rather than nobility, and slowly, the king became sympathetic to her cause. She was granted the freedom to speak at rallies, advocate for reform, and attend public events, which unnerved the nobility, who were determined to maintain the status quo.

During her pregnancy, one of the king’s retainers conspired against her, poisoning her with demon blood to ensure her demise. Her body rapidly deteriorated, but despite her suffering, she clung to life long enough to give birth. Shortly after, she succumbed to the affliction and passed away.

In the aftermath, rumors spread like wildfire, whispering that she had been of common blood all along, that her disease was the result of an impurity unfit to mix with nobility. The truth of her assassination was buried, and her legacy was twisted into a tale of shame rather than a symbol of change.
