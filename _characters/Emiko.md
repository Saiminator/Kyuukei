## Background

Emiko was married into the royal family as the result of a politial marrige, intent on fixing relations between the two families. Emiko also had a vast amount of magic potential and so the hope was that their child would inherit their magical prowess. At first, she fulfilled her role dutifully but distantly, understanding that her position was one of status, not love.

As time passed, the king became infatuated with her, truly starting to love her. Emiko shared her ideas of a kingdom build on equality, rather than nobility and slowly the king became sympathetic to her cause. She was allowed to speak at rallies, push for ideas and go to public events, causing unrest for the nobles intent on maintaining the status quo.

During her pregnancy, a plot was made by one of the kings retainers, to poison her with demon blood. Her body quickly took a turn for the worse as it began to deteriorate. Emiko did all she could to live to carry her child to birth but shortly after, passed away. After her death, rumors spreads about her having commoners blood, leading to her disease by trying to mix with nobility.
