## Background

TBW

## Abilities

**Limitless Mana:** Shizu was born with a mana core with such an affinity for mana that she is able to generate it faster than she can expell it. She is almost constantly leaking mana in the form of water around her body. 

**Spirit Blessing:** The founders of Shizu's village were blessed by a water spirit which was passed down to her, causing her water based spells to be more effective, and requiring little to no mana cost. Her affinity for water is so high that her excess mana is automatically converted to water and released around her body.
