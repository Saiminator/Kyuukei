## Background

Mika was born into the PAWN project, a secretive program dedicated to breeding powerful demi-humans with unique abilities. Unlike other subjects, Mika was deemed useless due to her apparent lack of abilities and was subjected to constant abuse, serving as a punching bag for stronger candidates. Eventually, the PAWN project decided she was unworthy of further investment and abandoned her on the streets.

Left to die, Mika was taken in by an innkeeper who ran a maid café, providing her with shelter and a new purpose. For the first time in her life, Mika experienced kindness and stability, working as a maid while slowly rebuilding her sense of self.

As she adjusted to her new life, Mika’s Future Sight ability began to manifest. Initially, the visions were fragmented and overwhelming, but she gradually learned to control them. With her ability, she became an adventurer, using her foresight to anticipate danger and avoid fatal encounters. 

Her remarkable combat skills and resilience, honed through years of mistreatment, eventually made her a highly sought-after adventurer. However, her past with the PAWN project still haunts her, and she remains wary of drawing their attention once more.

## Abilities

**Future Sight:** Mika has the ability to see brief glimpses into the near future, allowing her to react instinctively to events before they occur. While incredibly useful in combat, the further she looks ahead, the more uncertain and overwhelming the visions become. Extended use causes severe mental strain.

**Catlike Body:** Due to her demi-human lineage, Mika possesses enhanced agility, night vision, sharp reflexes, and heightened senses, making her naturally adept at dodging and reacting quickly.

**Poison Resistance:** Though never fully trained in it, Mika has built a minor resistance to weak poisons, including alcohol, due to her harsh upbringing.

**Increased Durability:** Mika’s years as a test subject in the PAWN project left her body abnormally resistant to physical and magical abuse. While she cannot regenerate like a healing factor, she can withstand significantly more punishment than an average person before succumbing to injuries.
