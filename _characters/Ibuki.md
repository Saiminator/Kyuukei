## Abilities

**Mana Mark Communication:**
Ibuki’s Mana Mark Communication is a technique she developed entirely on her own, refining it over years of trial and error. Struggling with traditional magic studies, she focused instead on experimenting with mana in unconventional ways. Her marks were unstable in the beginning, fading too quickly or interfering with each other, forcing her to spend years testing them on students and adjusting their structure until she perfected them. Now, her marks function as a relay system, allowing her to send messages directly into the minds of individuals or groups with unmatched efficiency.

Each student’s emblem carries one of her marks, ensuring that announcements reach everyone without disruption. The marks naturally fade over time, but those who bear them can recharge them with a small amount of mana, making them nearly self-sustaining. While the marks allow for two-way communication, Ibuki remains in control—only she can initiate a conversation, meaning students must ping her first and wait for a response if they wish to speak with her.

**Null Magic Visual Projections:**
Although Ibuki never studied Null Magic seriously, she developed a way to incorporate it into her communication system, allowing her to project maps, schedules, and visual effects through her marks. This ability was something she discovered through pure instinct, treating Null Magic more like a tool for artistic expression rather than combat. Her projections help students visualize information rather than just hearing it, making her announcements not only functional but also engaging.
