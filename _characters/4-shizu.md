## Background

Shizu was born with an extraordinary talent for magic and an immense reservoir of mana, a gift that set her apart as the prodigy of her village. Her village, deeply connected to a water spirit, revered a relic in the form of a swimsuit. This relic was used by the villagers to donate mana daily, a tradition that honored the spirit and fostered a sense of community. Shizu, ambitious and eager to harness the power contained within the relic, decided to wear the swimsuit, believing it would elevate her abilities to unprecedented levels. However, unknown to the villagers, the relic had been parasitized by Ink, a malevolent entity that had been feeding on the accumulated mana over the years.

Upon wearing the swimsuit, Ink immediately began to parasitize her, attempting to dominate her body and mana. Despite her prodigious talents, Shizu found herself struggling against the invasive force of Ink, fighting to maintain control over her own abilities and identity. The ink-like substance began spreading across her body, merging with her inside and out. She managed to create barriers within her mana streams to section off the infected areas and prevent Inky from spreading further. However, despite her efforts, Inky was able to partially fuse with her mana core, taking control of her right eye. Unable to remove Inky entirely, she suppressed it to keep it from taking over her body. The fusion with Inky and the embarrassment of being parasitized and trying to steal their relic forced Shizu to leave her village to protect her loved ones from the potential threat of Inky spreading.

## Abilities

**Limitless Mana:** Shizu was born with a mana core with such an affinity for mana that she is able to generate it faster than she can expell it. She is almost constantly leaking mana in the form of water around her body. 

**Parasitic Swimsuit:** Shizu is bonded with a swimsuit that hosts a parasite. Seeing it as her only option, she sealed the parasite onto her body to delay its corruption over her body, and to prevent it from infecting others. In order to stop the parasite from spreading, Shizu constantly outputs mana to prevent the parasite from entering her mana stream. This output of mana causes her body to drip an excess of water giving her the appearance of being wet at all times. Because of the mana it feeds her, Shizu has access to the parasites spells, although she refuses to use them since they would speed up her corruption. The parasite's spells mainly consist of corrupted water based spells, instead looking more like sludge or oil, spreading its corruption to whatever it touches.

**Spirit Blessing:** The founders of Shizu's village were blessed by a water spirit which was passed down to her, causing her water based spells to be more effective, and requiring little to no mana cost. Her affinity for water is so high that her excess mana is automatically converted to water and released around her body.
