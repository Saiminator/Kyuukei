## Background

Mizue von Lichtspiel is the eccentric and flamboyant headmaster of Ebonvale Academy, appointed largely due to her noble lineage—something she openly mocks and weaponizes to undermine the concept of status-based authority. Rather than hiding from her privilege, she exaggerates her laziness and cluelessness in public settings, often pretending to be helpless or aloof to test how others treat her.

In reality, Mizue is sharp, observant, and extraordinarily good at reading people. While she lacks the overwhelming talent of top-tier prodigies like Via or Shizu, she trained herself rigorously to reach a respectable level of magical prowess—enough to back up her position with real skill when needed.

She thrives in social environments, guiding students and faculty alike by gently (or dramatically) manipulating their expectations, emotions, and ambitions. Mizue sees education as a stage—and herself as both director and lead actress, orchestrating chaos with flair.

## Abilities

Null Magic Specialist:
Mizue uses null magic as her magic of choice to create barely-visible constructs—floating hands, barriers, projectiles, cages, platforms, and more. Her mastery of null magic gives her the illusion of omnipresence within her territory, often grabbing things or people from great distances without moving.

Social Manipulation:
Her true strength lies in people. Mizue can read a student’s mood in seconds and knows exactly how to poke, praise, or prank them to shape their behavior. She prefers to lead through nudging rather than commanding, and finds joy in stirring drama or growth through unexpected pressure.

Disarming Charisma:
Mizue’s eccentric behavior, flashy antics, and self-deprecation keep people guessing. It’s easy to underestimate her—which she encourages—until she turns the room on its head with a flick of her wand.
