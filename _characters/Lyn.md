## Background

Lyn is the leader of Cerulean Winds, an adventuring party that specializes in navigating and exploiting World-Merged Areas for rare materials and artifacts. Despite having no magical abilities of her own, Lynâ€™s sharp intellect, extensive trading knowledge, and mastery of enchanted equipment make her an invaluable asset to her team.

From a young age, she studied the art of trade and negotiation, ensuring that she could always make the most out of any deal. Her ability to assess valuables at a glance has made her a skilled merchant, and her knack for logistics and resource management keeps her party well-equipped and well-funded.

Unlike traditional adventurers, Lyn relies on magical tools and artifacts rather than direct combat ability. She plays a supportive yet strategic role, identifying opportunities, planning expeditions, and ensuring her team maximizes their profits while minimizing risk.

## Abilities

**Merchant:** Lyn has an exceptional understanding of trade, bargaining, and appraisal. She can accurately determine the value of goods, negotiate better prices, and secure lucrative deals. Her deep knowledge of magical artifacts allows her to recognize rare or dangerous items at a glance.

## Equipment

**Ring of Marking:** Allows Lyn to engrave a mana sigil onto any physical object by touching it with her pointer finger. Useful for tracking items or leaving subtle markings.  

**Ring of Mental Protection:** Shields her mind from mental intrusion, psychic attacks, or mind-reading attempts.  

**Amulet of Health:** Grants resistance to negative status effects such as paralysis, weakness, dizziness, and fatigue.  

**Star-Filled Circlet:** An intricate bracelet designed to store and cast the spell Shooting Stars. It has five slots for Mana-Stones, allowing Lyn to embed different magical energies for varied effects.  

**Location Coil:** A bracelet that guides the user toward pre-registered locations based on stored mana signatures. Helps her navigate unfamiliar areas efficiently.
