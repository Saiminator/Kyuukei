## Background

Ryn is the frontline tank of **Cerulean Winds**, a warrior who reinforces her body with magic to push her physical limits beyond what is naturally possible. As Lyn’s younger twin sister, she contrasts sharply with her sibling—where Lyn relies on strategy and magical tools, Ryn places her faith in raw **strength, endurance, and unshakable willpower**.

From childhood, she was fiercely protective of Lyn, training relentlessly to become strong enough to shield her from most harm. Through years of disciplined training, she has mastered the use of physical enhancement magic, making her stronger, faster, and more durable than even the most seasoned warriors. Ryn’s fighting style prioritizes defense—she absorbs damage and holds the line, ensuring her party can operate without fear.

Though serious and hard-working, Ryn’s devotion to protecting others often leads her to **overextend herself**, taking damage that would cripple most warriors without hesitation. Her resilience and unwavering loyalty make her the unbreakable shield of the group.

## Abilities

**Physical Enhancement Magic:** By channeling mana into her muscles, Ryn can increase her strength, speed, and durability beyond normal human limits. Her reinforced body allows her to fight **longer and harder than most warriors**.
