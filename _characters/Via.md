## Background

Via is the head of Lumin Academy's magic research department, specializing in fire magic but excelling in all studies. Despite not having massive potential, she has become the most important mage in the kingdom due to her deep understanding of magic. Currently, she is being loaned to Kaji to assist her and act as a spy for her kingdom. Kaji often overworks Via to the point of not sleeping for days, resulting in her clumsiness and narcoleptic tendencies. Kaji forces her to work overtime using multiple devices to ensure this behavior, which might be unethical, but Via manages.

## Abilities

**Spirit Blessing:** Via and her family have been blessed by fire spirits, granting them exceptional compatibility with all fire spells. Via has harnessed this blessing by integrating her research and theoretical knowledge into practical applications, significantly enhancing her fire magic abilities.

**Magic knowledge:** Via's understanding of magic at a fundamental level grants her a wide range of abilities. She can easily read and decipher magic circles, quickly grasping their effects and purposes. When spells are cast in front of her, she can break them down in real-time, identifying weaknesses and potential vulnerabilities in their structure. Additionally, her expertise extends to magical tools and enchantments, allowing her to identify and fix enchantments as well as spot curses before equipping or using items.

**Sleep Walker:** As a side effect of Kaji's overwork, Via has developed narcolepsy and remains tired at all hours of the day. When she randomly falls asleep, her body has been trained to work as efficiently as possible, running off muscle memory to perform actions with minimal effort. Despite being asleep, Via's body can handle routine tasks and familiar spells, though highly intricate research or new spell creation is beyond her sleepwalking capabilities.
