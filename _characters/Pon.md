## Background

Born and raised as part of the PAWN project, Pon was considered their greatest success. A Demi-Human with a naturally strong physique and a powerful Copy-Cat ability, she was trained from an early age to become an elite assassin. Her missions often involved capturing or eliminating individuals with powerful abilities, which she could temporarily steal and use to her advantage.

Despite being their most valuable asset, Pon was not treated with much respect. She was raised in a sterile, isolated environment, only receiving praise or rewards when completing missions successfully. This conditioning led her to associate joy solely with praise from her superiors, turning her into an unwaveringly loyal weapon of the kingdom.

Highly skilled in infiltration, assassination, and combat, Pon is a relentless hunter. However, years of conditioning have left her devoid of genuine emotions, acting only in pursuit of fulfilling orders and receiving validation.

## Abilities

**Copy-Cat:** Pon's unique ability allows her to temporarily steal skills or magic from others through physical contact. She can also steal active abilities if they are still connected to the caster's mana. She can hold multiple abilities at once, but maintaining them drains her stamina.

**Assassin Training:** Trained from childhood, Pon excels in stealth, agility, and close-quarters combat. She can eliminate targets quickly and efficiently, using both magical and non-magical techniques.

**Catlike Body:** As a Demi-Human, Pon possesses enhanced hearing, night vision, reflexes, and agility, making her an incredibly elusive fighter.

**Poison Resistance:** Due to rigorous training in assassination techniques, Pon has developed a resistance to various poisons and toxins, making her harder to incapacitate.
