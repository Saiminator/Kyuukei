## Background

A student of Ebonvale Academy, Yura is a semi-skilled mage adept at Null Magic and mana manipulation. Due to her affinity, she is reclusive and distances herself from others, preferring to hole up in her room and control her dolls. The headmaster frequently calls on Yura for assistance, attempting to break her out of her shell while also teasing her for her cute overreactions.

As a child, Yura developed her Thread Magic, playing with dolls and controlling small animals for fun. Other children were traumatized, watching her control animals as if they were lifeless puppets and began avoiding herâ€”some even bullying her out of fear. Due to this treatment, Yura became deeply disgusted by her own ability, refusing to use it on living beings. Instead, she focused solely on controlling objects, such as her dolls, which became her only real companions.



## Abilities

**Thread Magic:** Yura has an affinity for manipulation magic, manifested as threads of mana that she can attach to anything, allowing her to control them freely. However, she is uncomfortable using this ability on living creatures and strictly limits it to inanimate objects.

**Null magic:** Yura is adept at Null Magic, enabling her to create constructs of elementless mana, which she primarily uses for barriers or weaponry.
