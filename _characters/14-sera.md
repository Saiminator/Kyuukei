## Background

Sera was once a dedicated **hunter of evil**, wielding powerful **wind magic** and a formidable **spellblade technique**. Her life took a drastic turn when, after nearly dying in battle, she was saved by a powerful **wind spirit** that bonded with her mana core, permanently enhancing her abilities. With her **enhanced strength, speed, and near-perfect wind affinity**, she became an unstoppable force against her enemies.

However, despite her power and purpose, Sera always harbored a deep desire to be **protected instead of being the protector**. This longing led her to abandon her destiny after a noble **"saved" her from a monster**, despite her not truly needing the help. She willingly chose to **become his maid**, embracing a life of servitude while waiting for the day he could **justify marrying her despite her lower status**.

Though she has stepped away from her former path, the **wind spirit inside her remains restless**, seeking to pull her back into a life of battle. While she outwardly embraces her quiet, submissive role, the **warrior within her still exists**, ready to awaken if the time ever comes.

## Abilities

**Mana Control:** Due to her **spirit-bound nature**, Sera has **exceptional control over her mana**, allowing her to use magic with unparalleled efficiency.

**Wind Magic:** Sera possesses a **near-perfect affinity for wind magic**, allowing her to create powerful **blades of air, protective barriers, and high-speed movements** with ease.

**Enhanced Physicality:** The bond with her wind spirit has permanently **enhanced her strength, speed, and endurance**, making her **far more powerful than an average human**.

**Spellblade Combat:** Sera is a master of **integrating magic into melee combat**, using **conjured wind weapons** to strike with speed and precision.
